# üåç Spots App ‚Äì Circle 13 Team Project

Welcome to the Spots App project, built by Circle 13 students at AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering.  
Originally a simple HTML + CSS replication of a Figma design, the project now includes some JavaScript functionality and plans are underway to convert the app to React.

## üìå Project Overview

Spots App is a UI inspired by a Figma prototype. The layout is fully responsive and adjusts beautifully across all screen sizes.  
Our goal is to sharpen frontend development skills by building a pixel-perfect design and adding interactivity with JavaScript, with a future goal to convert to React and implement persistent state management.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage for persistence)
- Figma (for UI reference)
- React (planned for next phase)

## ‚ú® Features (Implemented)

- Responsive layout across all device sizes
- Clean, semantic HTML and CSS styling
- JavaScript-driven interactivity including:
  - *Edit Profile:* Users can update their profile information
  - *Add New Post:* Adding a new card dynamically appends to existing cards
  - *Preview Image Modal:* Clicking any card image opens a larger preview modal
  - *Modal Controls:* Escape key or clicking outside modals closes and clears them

## üöÄ What's Next

- Convert the app to React to improve component reusability and state management
- Enhance persistent data handling using React state and context/local storage
- Continue improving accessibility, responsiveness, and user experience
